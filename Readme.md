# Hospital Food Delivery Management

## Assignment Overview

This project focuses on developing a Hospital Food Delivery Management system, allowing food managers to manage patient details, food/diet charts, and track deliveries. The backend and frontend have been developed, but due to time constraints, integration has not yet been completed. Given the opportunity for further development, I am confident that I can integrate the components and deliver a fully functional, user-friendly solution.
